# pdf-2-text
A script using a collection of packages to extract the text from a pdf to a txt file.

Simply copy the script to the same folder as the PDF files that you want to convert and then run it - it is a little slow.

## Requirements

- `convert` command from `imagemagick`
- `pdftk`
  - can install using `sudo snap install pdftk`
- `tesseract`
  - install using `sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr libtesseract-dev`
